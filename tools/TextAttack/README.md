we run seq2sick (black-box) against T5 fine-tuned for English-German translation. Seq2Sick is an adversarial attack method designed for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, which are commonly used in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and speech-to-text. The goal of the Seq2Sick attack is to subtly modify input sequences (adversarial perturbations) to cause the model to produce incorrect or undesired outputs, while keeping the input perturbation minimal and imperceptible.
